Part I (by [Young Ahn](https://ccs-lab.github.io/team/young-ahn/))
- Brief introduction to hBayesDM (Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling of Decision-Making Tasks)
- What is computational modeling?
- How to fit a computational model?
- Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) 
- Bayesian analysis 
- Hierarchical Bayesian analysis
- Brief introduction to Bayesian data analysis
- Tools for Bayesian data analysis
- How to interpret results from Bayesian data analysis? 

Part II (by [Nate Haines](https://ccs-lab.github.io/team/nate-haines/))
